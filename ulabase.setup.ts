/**
 * What this starter needs from its Ulabase service.
 *
 *   npm i -D @ulabase/cli
 *   ulabase login
 *   ulabase setup --srv <srvId> --dry-run    # what is missing
 *   ulabase setup --srv <srvId>              # make it so
 *
 * Every step is a `check` and an `apply`: run it against a service already
 * configured and it writes nothing and reports each step satisfied. `--dry-run`
 * runs the checks only, which is the honest answer to "what is this service
 * missing".
 *
 * ## Why the feature flags are read, not written
 *
 * The `features` block in `environment.ts` has to agree with the "Features"
 * toggles of the Ulabase service. A feature that is off on the server
 * answers unauthenticated callers with `403`, so the app must not offer a
 * button for it.
 *
 * Two lists that must agree, kept in step by hand, in different repositories.
 * Nothing checked that they did, and the symptom of drift is a `403` on a
 * button the app went to the trouble of rendering. (The Angular starter at
 * least wrote the rule down in a comment; here it was not written anywhere.)
 *
 * So this file **imports the same environment the app imports** and derives the
 * server's configuration from it. The flags are stated once. Turning
 * `passwordReset` off in the app and re-running the setup turns it off on the
 * service too, because there is no second place to forget.
