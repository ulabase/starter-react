/**
 * The starter's service, **plus** the consents gate.
 *
 *   ulabase setup --srv <srvId> --file ulabase.setup.consents.ts
 *
 * Two setup files, one application. `ulabase.setup.ts` configures the accounts side
 * and nothing else; this one is that same setup with the gate's four documents
 * appended, which is why it imports it rather than restating it — the accounts
 * steps have one definition, and adding one there reaches both files.
 *
 * The app carries the gate's client code either way. Set a service up with
 * `ulabase.setup.ts` and no rule exists, so no request is ever answered `451`, so
 * the acceptance dialog never opens and the user is never asked. Nothing to
 * switch off in the app: an unasked question is the absence of a rule on the
 * server, not a flag here.
 *
 * ## What the gate needs from its Ulabase service.
 *
 *   npm i -D @ulabase/cli
 *   ulabase login
 *   ulabase setup --srv <srvId> --dry-run    # what is missing
 *   ulabase setup --srv <srvId>              # make it so
 *
 * This is Part 1 of
 * https://cloud.restheart.com/blog/require-terms-and-privacy-acceptance — four
 * server-side documents, there configured by hand in the console, here stated
 * as code.
 *
 * ## The versions live in one place
 *
 * In the article the two version strings appear **four times**: twice in the
 * permission's `mergeRequest`, and twice in the guard rule's condition. They
 * have to agree exactly, and the failure when they do not is quiet — a user
 * accepts, the acceptance is stamped with one version, the rule compares
 * against another, and they are blocked for ever by a form that says it worked.
 *
 * Here they are `TOS_VERSION` and `PP_VERSION`, and everything is derived. That
 * is most of what this file buys over following the article: publishing new
 * terms becomes editing two strings and re-running the setup.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not write the Terms or the Privacy Policy — those are `public/`, and
 * they are yours. It only decides which *versions* the service demands.

 * as values while the schema is being stored. Declared as a plain string,
 * every acceptance is rejected.
 *
 * Note also what is **not** required. The document is validated as it is
 * inserted, before the initial team is attached, so a schema demanding
 * `latestConsents`, `consents` or the team fields rejects every registration.
 *
 * One consequence to know before it surprises you: `_id` **is** required, and on
 * a `PUT /users/{id}` it arrives in the path rather than the body, so a direct
 * write is refused with `required key [_id] not found`. Registration through
 * `/auth/register` sends a whole document and passes. It means `createUser` from
 * a setup file, and hand-made users generally, need the id in the body too.
